1. Increasing Mileage (Hypermiling):
   - Tire Pressure: Keep it 2 PSI higher than recommended. Reduces friction.
   - AC Logic: On highway (80kmph+), use AC (windows open = drag). In city, use windows.
   - Coasting: Don't accelerate if you see a red light ahead. Let the car roll.

2. Second-Hand Buying Checklist:
   - Check Smoke: Blue smoke = Engine oil burning (Bad). Black smoke = Fuel issue.
   - Check Rust: Look under the carpet in the boot and wheel arches.
   - Test Drive: Turn music OFF. Listen for rattles/squeaks on bad roads.

3. Maintenance Hacks:
   - WD-40 is magic. Cleans rust, lubricates hinges, removes stickers.
   - Change Engine Oil every 5000-8000 km. It's the blood of the car.
   - Rotate tires every 10k km for even wear.

4. Breakdown Survival:
   - Car overheating? Turn OFF AC, Turn ON Heater (full blast). It sucks heat from engine.
   - Jump Start: Red to Red (+), Black to Metal (Ground). Never Black to Black (Spark risk).
