1. Pomodoro Technique:
   - 25 mins Focus + 5 mins Break. Brain loses focus after 25-30 mins.
   - After 4 cycles, take a long break.

2. Feynman Technique (Best way to learn):
   - Read a topic.
   - Explain it to a 5-year-old (Simplicity test).
   - If you use jargon, you don't understand it yet. Review again.

3. Active Recall:
   - Don't just re-read notes (Passive).
   - Close the book and try to recite everything. Struggle builds memory.

4. Spaced Repetition:
   - Revise at: 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 21 days.
   - This moves info from Short Term to Long Term memory.

5. Speed Reading:
   - Use a pacer (finger/pen) to guide eyes.
   - Stop sub-vocalization (reading aloud in head). It slows you down to talking speed.
