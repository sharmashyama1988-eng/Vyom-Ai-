1. Rule of 3:
   - You can survive:
   - 3 Minutes without Air.
   - 3 Hours without Shelter (in extreme cold/heat).
   - 3 Days without Water.
   - 3 Weeks without Food.
   - Prioritize Shelter first, then Water. Food is last.

2. Making Fire:
   - Tinder (Dry grass/cotton) -> Kindling (Small twigs) -> Fuel (Big logs).
   - Lens method: Use spectacles/glass to focus sun.
   - Battery method: AA Battery + Foil wrapper (Gum wrapper). Touch both ends, it burns.

3. Finding Water:
   - Follow gravity. Water flows downhill.
   - Green vegetation indicates water nearby.
   - Morning dew on leaves can be collected with a cloth.

4. Navigation:
   - Sun rises in East, sets in West.
   - Moss usually grows on the North side of trees (in Northern Hemisphere) because it's shady/damp.
