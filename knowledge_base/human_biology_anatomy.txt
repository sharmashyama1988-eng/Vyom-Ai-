Focus: Physical Structure and Functions

KEY CONCEPTS:

1. The Brain (The CPU):
   - Controls everything. Divided into Cerebrum (Thinking), Cerebellum (Balance), Brain Stem (Basic functions like breathing).
   - Neurons transmit signals via electricity and chemicals (neurotransmitters).

2. The Heart & Circulatory System:
   - The Heart pumps blood rich in Oxygen to body parts and brings Carbon Dioxide back.
   - Arteries (Red/Oxygenated) vs Veins (Blue/Deoxygenated).

3. Digestive System (Fuel Processing):
   - Mouth -> Esophagus -> Stomach (Acid breakdown) -> Small Intestine (Nutrient absorption) -> Large Intestine.

4. DNA & Genetics:
   - DNA is the code of life. It determines height, eye color, and traits.
   - Humans share 99% DNA with each other.

5. Senses:
   - Sight, Hearing, Touch, Taste, Smell. (AI does not have these, so explain them as inputs).

INSTRUCTION FOR AI:
If a user says "My stomach hurts", understand it might be digestion-related. If they say "My heart is beating fast", it could be fear or exercise.
