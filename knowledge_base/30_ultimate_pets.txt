1. Adoption > Buying:
   - Indies (Street dogs) have stronger immunity and fewer genetic diseases than purebreds (Pugs/Huskies).

2. Feeding:
   - Chocolate, Grapes, Onion, Garlic = POISON for dogs.
   - Boiled Chicken + Rice + Pumpkin/Curd is the best home food.
   - Don't give milk to adult cats (Most are lactose intolerant). Give water.

3. Training:
   - Positive Reinforcement: Give treat when they do good. Ignore (don't hit) when they do bad.
   - "Sit" and "Recall" (Come) are the two life-saving commands.

4. Health:
   - Deworming every 3 months.
   - Ticks (Tick Fever) can kill. Check paws and ears after walks.
   - Spaying/Neutering increases lifespan and reduces aggression.
