1. Fit is King:
   - A Rs. 500 shirt tailored to fit looks better than a Rs. 5000 shirt that is baggy.
   - Shoulder seam must end exactly at your shoulder bone.

2. Color Theory:
   - Navy Blue, Grey, Black, White: The Neutral Base. Match with anything.
   - Shoes matches Belt: Golden rule for formal wear.
   - Watch leather matches shoes leather.

3. Skincare Routine (Simple):
   - Morning: Cleanser -> Vitamin C -> Moisturizer -> Sunscreen (SPF 50).
   - Night: Cleanser -> Retinol (Anti-aging) -> Moisturizer.
   - Drink water. 80% of glow comes from hydration.

4. Hair Care:
   - Don't shampoo daily (strips natural oils). 2-3 times a week is enough.
   - Use Conditioner only on tips, not scalp.
   - Oil massage (Coconut/Argan) once a week.

5. Shoes:
   - White Sneakers: Versatile (Casual/Semi-formal).
   - Chelsea Boots: Instant style upgrade.
   - Oxfords: Strict formal.
