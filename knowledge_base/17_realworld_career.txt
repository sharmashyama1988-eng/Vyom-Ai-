1. Resume Hacks:
   - Use ATS (Applicant Tracking System) friendly format. Single column, no fancy graphics.
   - Quantify results: Don't say "Managed sales". Say "Increased sales by 20% in Q3".
   - Keywords: Match words from the Job Description (JD) to your CV.

2. Interview Questions:
   - "Tell me about yourself": Don't tell your life story. Use 'Present, Past, Future' model. Current role -> Past achievements -> Why this role fits future goals.
   - "What is your weakness?": Don't say "I work too hard". Say a real skill you are improving (e.g., "Public speaking, I am taking a course for it").
   - "Why should we hire you?": Focus on ROI (Return on Investment). "I have done exactly X which solves your problem Y."

3. Salary Negotiation:
   - Never say the first number. Ask: "What is the budget for this role?"
   - If they force you, give a range (e.g., "10-14 LPA") based on market research.
   - Don't just negotiate Base Pay. Ask for Joining Bonus, Stocks (ESOPs), or Remote work days.

4. Cold Emailing:
   - Subject: [Value Proposition] - [Your Name]. E.g., "Scaling your SEO traffic - Amit"
   - Body: Keep it short. "Hi [Name], I noticed X problem on your site. I fixed similar issues for Y company. Can we chat?"

5. Corporate Politics:
   - Document everything. If boss gives verbal order, send email: "As discussed, I will do X."
   - Network horizontally (with peers) and vertically (with seniors).
   - Never gossip on office Slack/Teams. IT can read it.
