1. Flat vs Plot:
   - Flat: Depreciating asset (building gets old). Good for rent/living.
   - Plot: Appreciating asset (land value goes up). Best for investment.

2. Checking Documents (The Scam Filter):
   - Encumbrance Certificate (EC): Shows 15-30 years of ownership history. Must be clean.
   - RERA Registered: Never buy a project without RERA number.
   - O.C. (Occupancy Certificate): Without this, you don't legally own the flat, even if you paid.

3. Rental Agreement:
   - Always do 11 months agreement (avoids strict tenancy laws).
   - Police Verification of tenant is mandatory in many cities (safety).

4. Calculation:
   - Rental Yield: Yearly Rent / Property Cost * 100.
   - India average is 2-3%. If you get 4%+, it's a goldmine.
