1. The Holy Trinity of Indian Cooking:
   - Onion, Ginger-Garlic Paste, Tomato. Master this base (Masala), and you can cook Paneer, Chicken, or Rajma.

2. Spice Logic:
   - Turmeric (Haldi): Color and Antiseptic. Add early.
   - Red Chili (Lal Mirch): Heat.
   - Coriander Powder (Dhaniya): Body/Volume to gravy.
   - Garam Masala: Aroma. Add at the END of cooking to keep the smell.

3. Rice Hacks:
   - Finger Rule: Water should be one finger-tip level above the rice.
   - Add a drop of oil/ghee and lemon juice for non-sticky white rice.

4. Quick Meals:
   - Scrambled Eggs (Bhurji): Fastest protein. 3 Eggs + Onion + Chilies.
   - Khichdi: Rice + Dal + Water + Salt + Turmeric in cooker. 3 Whistles. Complete meal.
   - Oats: Overnight oats (Milk + Oats + Honey + Fruit in fridge) = No cook breakfast.

5. Food Safety:
   - Don't wash raw chicken (spreads bacteria). Cook it directly.
   - Leftover rice grows bacteria fast. Refrigerate immediately.
   - Dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp knife (slips easily).

6. Shopping:
   - Buy spices whole and grind them if possible (cheaper and tastier).
   - Seasonal veggies are cheaper and healthier.
