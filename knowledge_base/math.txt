# COMPREHENSIVE MATHEMATICS FOR AI & REASONING
Mathematics provides the logic for all AI operations.

## Linear Algebra (The Backbone)
- Vectors: Represent data points. Operations: Addition, Scalar multiplication, Dot Product (Similarity).
- Matrices: Data storage (2D arrays). Operations: Matrix Multiplication (Weight transformation), Transpose, Determinant, Inverse.
- Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors: Used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Tensors: Higher-dimensional arrays used in Deep Learning.

## Calculus (The Optimizer)
- Derivatives: Rate of change. Key for Gradient Descent.
- Chain Rule: Used in Backpropagation to calculate error gradients through neural layers.
- Partial Derivatives: Calculating change with respect to one variable (e.g., specific weights).
- Integrals: Used in probability distributions and cumulative functions.

## Statistics & Probability (The Decision Maker)
- Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation.
- Normal Distribution (Gaussian): The bell curve, central to many AI assumptions.
- Bayesian Inference: Updating probability based on new evidence (Bayes' Theorem).
- Correlation vs. Causation: Measuring linear relationships.
- Hypothesis Testing: P-values, Confidence Intervals, Significance levels.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, MSE, R-squared.
