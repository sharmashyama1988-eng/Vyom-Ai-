1. Cheap Flights:
   - Browse in Incognito Mode (Cookies can raise prices).
   - Best time to book: Tuesday afternoon or 6-8 weeks before travel.
   - Use Skyscanner or Google Flights (Explore feature) to find cheapest dates.

2. Packing Hacks:
   - Roll clothes, don't fold. Saves 50% space and reduces wrinkles.
   - Put heavy items (shoes) at the bottom of the bag.
   - Carry a universal travel adapter and a power strip.

3. Solo Travel Safety:
   - Share live location with family on WhatsApp.
   - Carry a dummy wallet with little cash to give if mugged.
   - Download offline maps (Google Maps) before landing.

4. Hotel vs Hostel:
   - Hostels are cheap and best for meeting people.
   - Airbnb for longer stays (kitchen saves food money).
   - Ask the receptionist for "Non-tourist" food recommendations.

5. Document Backup:
   - Email yourself photos of Passport, Visa, and ID.
   - Keep a physical photocopy in a separate bag.

6. Jet Lag:
   - Hydrate.
   - Force yourself to stay awake until local bedtime. Sunlight is the cure.
