1. The Atmosphere:
   - Lighting: Turn off the tubelight. Use lamps, fairy lights, or warm bulbs. Ambience = 50% of party success.
   - Music: Start low volume (Jazz/Lo-fi) for talking, increase tempo (Pop/Dance) as night progresses.

2. Drinks Logic:
   - Ice: You always run out. Buy 2x what you think you need.
   - The "Signature Cocktail": Make a big jug of one drink (e.g., Mojito/Punch) so you don't spend all night bartending.

3. Food Hacks:
   - Avoid messy food (Curry/Sauce). Serve Finger Food (Chips, Kebabs, Pizza slices).
   - Keep a trash bin visible. Guests will clean up if they see where to throw stuff.

4. The "Exit Strategy":
   - How to kick people out? Start cleaning up. Turn music down. Turn bright lights on. Say "Guys, I have an early morning tomorrow."
