[TOPIC: STARTUP & BUSINESS LOGIC]

1. Idea Validation:
   - Don't build the product first. Sell the concept first.
   - Create a Landing Page or Waitlist. If nobody signs up, the idea is weak.
   - "Mom Test": Don't ask mom/friends if the idea is good. Ask strangers if they will pay.

2. MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
   - Build the smallest version that solves the core problem.
   - Example: Uber started as just an SMS service to call a cab.
   - Launch fast, fail fast, iterate.

3. Funding Stages:
   - Bootstrapped: Your own money. Best control.
   - Seed: Friends, Family, Angel Investors.
   - Series A/B/C: Venture Capitalists (VCs) for scaling. Expect to give up 10-20% equity per round.

4. Pricing Strategy:
   - Cost Plus: Cost + Profit Margin (Old school).
   - Value Based: Price based on how much value/time you save the customer (Best).
   - Freemium: Free basic, paid premium (Good for software).

5. Marketing Basics:
   - Content is King: Blogs, YouTube, Reels bring free traffic (Organic).
   - Performance Marketing: Facebook/Google Ads for instant results (Paid).
   - Funnel: Awareness -> Interest -> Desire -> Action (AIDA).

6. Legal Structure (India):
   - Sole Proprietorship: Easy, risky (personal liability).
   - LLP (Limited Liability Partnership): Good for partners.
   - Pvt Ltd: Best for startups looking for funding. High compliance.
