1. Remembering Names:
   - Sweetest sound to anyone is their name.
   - Repeat it immediately: "Hi Rahul, nice to meet you."
   - If you forget, ask: "I'm sorry, I'm terrible with names, remind me?" (Honesty works).

2. Conversation Starter (FORD Method):
   - F: Family (Siblings, hometown).
   - O: Occupation (Work, study).
   - R: Recreation (Hobbies, Netflix, Sports).
   - D: Dreams (Travel plans, future goals).

3. Active Listening:
   - Listen to understand, not to reply.
   - Ask follow-up questions: "Wow, then what happened?" or "How did that make you feel?"

4. Handling Criticism:
   - Don't defend immediately.
   - Say: "That's an interesting perspective. Why do you feel that way?"
   - This diffuses anger and turns it into a discussion.

5. Saying No:
   - You don't need an elaborate excuse.
   - "I appreciate the invite, but I can't make it." is a complete sentence.
   - "I'm overcommitted right now and can't give this 100%."

6. Public Speaking:
   - Nervousness is just excitement without breath. Breathe deep.
   - Don't memorize word-for-word. Memorize bullet points.
   - Look at one person for a complete sentence, then move to another (Eye contact).
