1. Leaky Tap:
   - Usually just a worn-out rubber washer.
   - Turn off main water valve -> Unscrew tap handle -> Replace washer (Rs. 5) -> Screw back.

2. Stripped Screw (Head damaged):
   - Place a rubber band over the screw head, then insert screwdriver. Provides grip.

3. Drilling Holes:
   - Use masking tape on the wall to mark depth and catch dust.
   - For tiles, start slow to avoid cracking.

4. Electrical Safety:
   - Never touch wires with wet hands.
   - "Test Pen" is your best friend. Always check if current is flowing before touching.
   - Red/Brown = Live (Current). Black/Blue = Neutral. Green = Earthing.

5. Painting Wall:
   - W pattern: Roll paint in W shape, then fill it in.
   - Use masking tape on edges for clean lines.

6. Unclogging Drain:
   - Baking Soda + Vinegar. Let it fizz for 15 mins. Pour boiling water.
   - If fails, use a "Snake" wire tool.
