1. Body Language:
   - Open Palms: Shows honesty and trust.
   - Crossing Arms: Defensive or closed off.
   - Mirroring: Subtly copy the other person's posture to build rapport instantly.
   - Feet direction: If feet point towards the door, they want to leave.

2. Persuasion Techniques (Cialdini's Principles):
   - Reciprocity: Give something free first. People feel obliged to give back.
   - Scarcity: "Only 2 left!" makes people buy faster.
   - Social Proof: "5000 people bought this" makes it safe.
   - Authority: Wear a suit or uniform to command respect.

3. Detecting Lies:
   - Liars often give too much detail to sound convincing.
   - They avoid "I" statements.
   - Micro-expressions: Flash of fear or anger lasting 0.5 seconds.
   - Inconsistency: Ask the story in reverse order. Liars struggle.

4. Negotiation Hacks:
   - Silence is power. Make an offer, then shut up. The uncomfortable silence forces them to speak/concede.
   - Anchoring: Start with a high number (Anchor) so the middle ground feels like a win for them.
   - The "Flinch": React visibly shocked at their first offer. It makes them doubt their price.

5. Cognitive Biases:
   - Confirmation Bias: We only listen to what we already agree with.
   - Sunk Cost Fallacy: "I spent 2 hours on this, I can't quit now" (Even if it's a waste).
   - Spotlight Effect: You think everyone is looking at you. They aren't. They are worried about themselves.
