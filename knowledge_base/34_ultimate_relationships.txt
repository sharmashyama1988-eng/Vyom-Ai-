1. Green Flags:
   - They apologize when wrong.
   - They listen to understand, not to argue.
   - They are kind to waiters/drivers.

2. Red Flags:
   - Love Bombing: Too much affection too soon (Manipulative).
   - Gaslighting: "You are crazy, that never happened." (Making you doubt reality).
   - Stonewalling: Giving silent treatment during conflict.

3. Long Distance Survival:
   - Schedule calls. Spontaneity is hard, routine keeps it alive.
   - Have an "End Date". Distance works only if you know when it ends.
   - Do things together online (Watch movie, play game).

4. Conflict Resolution:
   - Use "I" statements: "I feel hurt when..." instead of "You always do this..." (Accusatory).
   - Never go to sleep angry? Myth. sometimes sleep fixes the mood. Resolve it tomorrow calmly.
