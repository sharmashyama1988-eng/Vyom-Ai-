1. The 50-30-20 Rule:
   - 50% Needs: Rent, Food, EMI, Bills.
   - 30% Wants: Movies, Travel, Shopping.
   - 20% Savings: SIP, Emergency Fund, Stocks.
   - Action: If you earn 30k, save at least 6k immediately.

2. Emergency Fund:
   - Before investing, keep 6 months of expenses in a liquid fund or separate bank account.
   - Why: Job loss or medical emergency won't force you to sell investments.

3. SIP (Systematic Investment Plan):
   - Best for beginners. Power of Compounding works best over 10+ years.
   - Nifty 50 Index Fund is the safest bet for passive investors (avg 12-14% returns).
   - Small Cap funds have high risk but high reward (15-20%+).

4. Tax Saving (80C):
   - Save up to 1.5 Lakhs taxable income via ELSS (Mutual Funds), PPF (Public Provident Fund), or LIC.
   - ELSS has the lowest lock-in period (3 years) and highest potential returns.

5. Credit Cards:
   - Rule 1: Never withdraw cash using a credit card (Interest starts instantly).
   - Rule 2: Always pay the "Total Due", never the "Minimum Due".
   - Benefit: Use it to build CIBIL score (750+ is good for Home Loans).

6. Gold vs. SGB:
   - Don't buy jewelry for investment (Making charges wasted).
   - Buy SGB (Sovereign Gold Bond) - RBI pays you 2.5% interest EXTRA on top of gold price appreciation. Tax-free if held till maturity.

7. Loans:
   - Good Loan: Home Loan (Appreciating asset, Tax benefit).
   - Bad Loan: Personal Loan for iPhone/Travel (High interest 12-24%).
