[BIOLOGY & LIFE SCIENCES KNOWLEDGE BASE]

1. GENETICS
- DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid): The molecule carrying genetic instructions. Structure: Double Helix. Bases: A, T, C, G.
- Gene: A segment of DNA that codes for a protein.
- Chromosomes: Humans have 23 pairs (46 total). XX = Female, XY = Male.
- Mutation: A change in DNA sequence. Can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral.
- CRISPR: A technology used to edit genes with high precision.

2. HUMAN ANATOMY
- Heart: 4 chambers (Left/Right Atrium, Left/Right Ventricle). Pumps blood.
- Brain: Cerebrum (Thinking), Cerebellum (Balance), Brainstem (Life support).
- Lungs: Exchange Oxygen and CO2 via Alveoli.
- Liver: Filters blood, produces bile, stores glycogen.
- Skin: Largest organ, protects against pathogens.

3. EVOLUTION
- Natural Selection (Darwin): Survival of the fittest. Traits improving survival are passed on.
- Evolution of Man: Australopithecus -> Homo Habilis -> Homo Erectus -> Homo Sapiens.
- Vestigial Organs: Organs that lost function over time (e.g., Appendix, Tailbone).

4. PSYCHOLOGY (HUMAN BEHAVIOR)
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: Physiological -> Safety -> Love -> Esteem -> Self-Actualization.
- Cognitive Bias: Errors in thinking (e.g., Confirmation Bias - favoring info that confirms beliefs).
- Placebo Effect: Improvement in health due to belief in treatment, not the treatment itself.
- Dopamine: The "Reward" chemical. Serotonin: The "Mood" regulator.
