[COMPUTER SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE BASE]

1. ALGORITHMS & DATA STRUCTURES
- Big O Notation: Measures the efficiency of an algorithm (Time & Space complexity).
- Array: Fixed-size, contiguous memory. Fast access (O(1)), slow insertion/deletion.
- Linked List: Nodes with data + pointer. Dynamic size. Fast insertion, slow access (O(n)).
- Stack: LIFO (Last In First Out). Used in recursion, undo mechanisms.
- Queue: FIFO (First In First Out). Used in task scheduling.
- Hash Table: Key-value pairs. O(1) average lookup time.
- Binary Search: O(log n) search on sorted arrays.

2. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)
- Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms that learn patterns from data (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning).
- Neural Networks: Layers of nodes (neurons) mimicking the human brain.
- Deep Learning: Multi-layered neural networks (CNN for images, RNN/Transformer for text).
- LLM (Large Language Model): Transformer-based models trained on vast text data (e.g., GPT, Llama, Vyom).
- Backpropagation: The method used to update weights in a neural network to minimize error.

3. CYBERSECURITY
- Encryption: Converting data into unreadable code (AES, RSA).
- Phishing: Deceptive emails/links to steal credentials.
- DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service attack to crash a server.
- SQL Injection: Inserting malicious SQL code into a query to manipulate a database.
- Zero-Day Exploit: An attack that targets a software vulnerability unknown to the vendor.

4. WEB DEVELOPMENT
- HTML: Structure of the web.
- CSS: Styling and layout.
- JavaScript: Interactivity and logic.
- REST API: Stateless architecture for web services (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Database: SQL (Relational - MySQL, PostgreSQL) vs NoSQL (Document - MongoDB).
