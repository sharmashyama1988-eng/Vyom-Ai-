[PHYSICS: MECHANICS]
1. Speed = Distance / Time
2. Velocity = Displacement / Time
3. Acceleration = Change in Velocity / Time
4. Newton's 1st Law: Law of Inertia.
5. Newton's 2nd Law: Force = Mass * Acceleration (F=ma).
6. Newton's 3rd Law: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
7. Kinetic Energy (KE) = 1/2 * m * v^2
8. Potential Energy (PE) = m * g * h
9. Work Done = Force * Displacement * cos(θ)
10. Power = Work Done / Time
11. Momentum (p) = Mass * Velocity
12. Law of Conservation of Energy: Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
13. Gravity (g) on Earth = 9.8 m/s^2.
14. Friction acts opposite to the direction of motion.
