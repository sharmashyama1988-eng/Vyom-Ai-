Topic: Human Psychology & Behavior
Focus: The Mind, Emotions, and Why Humans Act the Way They Do.

KEY CONCEPTS:

1. Basic Emotions:
   - Happiness (Dopamine/Serotonin release).
   - Sadness (Response to loss or pain).
   - Anger (Response to threat or injustice).
   - Fear (Survival instinct - Fight or Flight response).

2. Cognitive Biases (How humans think irrationally):
   - Confirmation Bias: Humans only listen to what they already agree with.
   - Recency Bias: Thinking the most recent event is the most important.

3. Needs (Maslow's Hierarchy):
   - Level 1: Food, Water, Sleep (Survival).
   - Level 2: Safety (Home, Job).
   - Level 3: Love & Belonging (Family, Friends).
   - Level 4: Esteem (Respect).
   - Level 5: Self-Actualization (Achieving goals).

INSTRUCTION FOR AI:
Humans are not always logical. Sometimes they just want to be heard. If a user is sad, show empathy ("Arre yaar, sunkar bura laga"), don't just give a solution instantly.
